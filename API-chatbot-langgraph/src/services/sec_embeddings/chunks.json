    "content": "Section 1: Overview\n\nThe following data sets provide information extracted from XBRL\nsubmissions filed with the Commission in a flattened data format to assist\nusers in more easily consuming the data for analysis. The data is sourced from\nselected information found in the XBRL tagged financial statements submitted by\nfilers to the Commission.  These data sets currently include quarterly and\nannual numeric data rendered by the Commission in the primary financial\nstatements submitted by filers. Certain additional fields (e.g. Standard\nIndustrial Classification (SIC)) used in the Commissions EDGAR system are also\nincluded to help in supporting the use of the data.  The information has\nbeen taken directly from submissions created by each registrant, and the data\nis as filed by the registrant.  The information will be updated\nquarterly. Data contained in documents filed after the last business day of the\nquarter will be included in the next quarterly posting.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Financial Statement Data Sets contain\ninformation derived from structured data filed with the Commission by\nindividual registrants as well as Commission-generated filing identifiers.\nBecause the data sets are derived from information provided by individual\nregistrants, we cannot guarantee the accuracy of the data sets. In addition, it\nis possible inaccuracies or other errors were introduced into the data sets\nduring the process of extracting the data and compiling the data sets. Finally,\nthe data sets do not reflect all available information, including certain\nmetadata associated with Commission filings. The data sets are intended to\nassist the public in analyzing data contained in Commission filings; however,\nthey are not a substitute for such filings. Investors should review the full\nCommission filings before making any investment decision.\n\nThe data extracted from the XBRL submissions is organized\ninto four data sets containing information about submissions, numbers, taxonomy\ntags, and presentation.  Each data set consists of rows and columns and is\nprovided as a tab-delimited TXT format file.  The data sets are as\nfollows:\n\n·SUB Submission data set; this includes one record for each XBRL\nsubmission with amounts rendered by the Commission in the primary financial\nstatements. The set includes fields of information pertinent to the submission\nand the filing entity. Information is extracted from the SECs EDGAR system and\nthe filings submitted to the SEC by registrants.\n\n·NUM Number data set; this includes one row for each distinct\namount appearing on the primary financial statements rendered by the Commission\nfrom each submission included in the SUB data set.\n\n·TAG Tag data set; includes defining information about each numerical\ntag.  Information includes tag descriptions (documentation labels),\ntaxonomy version information and other tag attributes.\n\n·PRE Presentation data set; this provides information about how\nthe tags and numbers were presented in the primary financial statements as\nrendered by the Commission.",
